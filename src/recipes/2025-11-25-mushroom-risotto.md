description: A luxurious Italian rice dish with earthy mushrooms, Parmesan cheese, and a creamy texture. This restaurant-quality risotto is worth the stirring!
ingredients:
  - 6 cups chicken or vegetable broth
  - 3 tbsp olive oil
  - 1 lb mixed mushrooms, sliced
  - 1 small onion, finely diced
  - 2 cloves garlic, minced
  - 1 1/2 cups Arborio rice
  - 1/2 cup dry white wine
  - 1/2 cup grated Parmesan cheese
  - 3 tbsp butter
  - 2 tbsp fresh parsley, chopped
  - Salt and pepper to taste
instructions:
  - Heat broth in a saucepan and keep it warm over low heat.
  - In a large skillet, heat 2 tbsp olive oil over medium-high heat. Add mushrooms and cook until golden brown, about 5-7 minutes. Season with salt and pepper. Remove and set aside.
  - In the same skillet, add remaining olive oil and butter. Add onion and cook until softened, about 3 minutes.
  - Add garlic and cook for 1 minute until fragrant.
  - Add Arborio rice and stir to coat with oil, toasting for 2 minutes.
  - Pour in white wine and stir until absorbed.
  - Add warm broth one ladle at a time, stirring frequently and allowing each addition to be absorbed before adding more. This process takes about 20-25 minutes.
  - When rice is creamy and al dente, stir in cooked mushrooms, Parmesan cheese, and remaining butter.
  - Season with salt and pepper to taste.
  - Garnish with fresh parsley and extra Parmesan. Serve immediately.
